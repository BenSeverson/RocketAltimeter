High Power Rocket Altimeter
===============
This is an altimeter for [high power rocketry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-power_rocketry). Sources include the PIC Micro firmware, Eagle PCB layout, and Windows configuration/log download program.

Features:
- dual payload deployment
- altitude and deployment logging to non-volatile EEPROM
- native USB support for configuration and log downloading
- audible max altitude readout
- pre-launch readiness audible indicator and rocket recovery/location beep
- simple 2-layer PCB with mainly SMT components designed to be made at home

**Note:** I started this project back in 2007 when I was in college but life got in the way before I had a chance to complete it. I've uploaded it here for archival purposes and maybe someone will find it useful. If you are looking for an open source altimeter, I'd highly suggest [Altus Metrum](http://altusmetrum.org/) which is complete, much more advanced, and actually being developed/maintained.
